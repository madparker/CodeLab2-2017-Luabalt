function building:makeBuilding(x, y, tileSize)

--when we want to make a building, the first thing we have to do is set the "metaTable" for that building
--the metatable "is an ordinary Lua table that defines the behavior of the original value under certain special operations"
--it "controls how an object behaves in arithmetic operations, order comparisons, concatenation, length operation, and indexing."
--in this case, the building class has a table ({}), which is used to make ALL buildings
-- so before we can make the building, we want to set the metatable of the building instance being created
-- essentially, this allows us to make buildings of various shapes and sizes in different locations
  local self = setmetatable({}, building)

  --with the metatable set, we call the "setupBuilding" method
  --this takes the x position of the building, the y position, and the tileSize
  self:setupBuilding(x, y, tileSize)

  return self
end

--so y is always set in the function itself, and never taken as a parameter
--I assume this is because we want uniform Y positions
function building:setupBuilding(x, tileSize, hasCrate)

--set tileSize in the metatable
--set x in the metatable
--set y in the metatable
  self.tileSize = tileSize
  self.x = x
  self.y = 300

  --set width and height, body, and shape, but with some new fun math
  --math.ceil (x): Returns the smallest integer larger than or equal to x.
  -- so we set a random height and width love.math.random( ) 
  self.width  = math.ceil((1 * 10) + 20)
  self.height = math.ceil(5 + love.math.random( ) * 7)
  --self.height = 7 (I'm guessing the original code had uniform heights?)

  --Body, as we saw in Chris' comments, is like the rigidBody and allows physics forces interact with it
  --we pass it the world, x & y coordinates of 0, and set it to static so that it DOES NOT MOVE
  self.body = love.physics.newBody(world, 0, 0, "static")

  --attaches a collider to the body using all the variable set before this
  self.shape = love.physics.newRectangleShape(self.x, self.y, 
                                              self.tileSize * self.width, 
                                              self.tileSize * self.height)
  
  --associates a Lua value with a fixture
  fixture = love.physics.newFixture(self.body, self.shape)

  --now we can refer to the building by using the string "Building"
  fixture:setUserData("Building")
  self.crate_body = love.physics.newBody(world, self.x, self.y - (self.tileSize * (self.height - 5)), "dynamic")

--this is the update function that runs on buildings that were made
--it takes a body, a timescale, and another building
--in this case, all buildings are being propogated by the first two buildings
--each time a building gets made, it sets up a new building using the SECOND building built
--this in turn calls all the necessary functions until we get to that second building building more buildings and so on.

  -- draw Method
	--	Signature:	draw( drawable, x, y, r, sx, sy, ox, oy, kx, ky )
	--	Definition: Renders the image at the position and scale
	--	Parameters:
	--				Drawable		drawable	: the thing to be rendered. Image extends from Drawable
	--				number			x			: the position to draw the object (x-axis)
	--				number			y			: the position to draw the object (y-axis)
	--				number			r			: the orientation of the object
	--				number			sx			: Scale factor (x-axis)
	--				number			sy			: Scale factor (y-axis)
	--				number			ox			: Origin offset (x-axis)
	--				number			ox			: Origin offset (y-axis)
	--				number			kx			: Shearing factor (x-axis)
	--				number			ky			: Shearing factor (y-axis)
										--	What is Shearing factor
											-- The distance a point moves due to shear divided by the 
											-- perpendicular distance of a point from the invariant line.
											--What is shear
												-- A transformation in which all points along a given line L 
												-- remain fixed while other points are shifted parallel to L 
												-- by a distance proportional to their perpendicular distance 
												-- from L
